# monty-hall
This is a simulation of the Monty Hall problem. The Monty Hall problem is a stats problems where a game contestant has an option of 3 doors. Two doors have goats behind them, one has a car. The contestant picks one door. The gameshow host reveals a goat behind a different door. Now, the contestant has the option of sticking with the door they already picked, or switching to the other unknown door. This simulation runs 1000 times to prove that it is statistically a better option to switch doors to find the car. When you run the simulation, it will tell you how many goats and how many cars you would win if you played 1000 times staying on your first door, 1000 times switching doors, and then 1000 times of randomly choosing between staying and switching.
